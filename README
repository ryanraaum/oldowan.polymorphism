Utilities for the management of molecular polymorphism data.

oldowan.polymorphism is a small bioinformatic utility for the management
of molecular polymorphism data.

Installation Instructions
=========================

This package is pure Python and has no dependencies outside of the standard
library. The easist way to install is using ``easy_install`` from the
setuptools_ package.  This usually goes something like this::

	$ easy_install oldowan.polymorphism

or on a unix-like system, assuming you are installing to the main Python
``site-packages`` directory as a non-privileged user, this::

	$ sudo easy_install oldowan.polymorphism

You may also use the standard python distutils setup method. Download the
current source archive from the file list towards the bottom of this page,
unarchive it, and install. On Mac OS X and many other unix-like systems, having
downloaded the archive and changed to the directory containing this archive in
your shell, this might go something like::

	$ tar xvzf oldowan.polymorphism*
	$ cd oldowan.polymorphism*
	$ python setup.py install

Quick Start
===========

This package provides a single utility class, ``Polymorphism``. Import
this class from oldowan.polymorphism::

  >>> from oldowan.polymorphism import Polymorphism

Create a new Polymorphism object::

  >>> p1 = Polymorphism(16223,0,'A','T')

The Polymorphism constructor requires 3 arguments and accepts and optional
fourth argument. These are (in order):

  1. ``position``, integer.  
  2. ``insert``, 0 if polymorphism is exactly at that position, or 1,2,3,... if
     insertion after.  
  3. ``value``, character value of polymorphism 
  4. ``reference``, optional value of a reference sequence at that position
